<p>As democracy quickly erodes in the United States, it is important to archive and analyze the media being collected by the public regarding ICE and immigration enforcement.</p>
<p>The following map is a proof of concept that utilizes Bluesky posts to show how videos shared on social media can be tied to spatial data and visualized.</p>
